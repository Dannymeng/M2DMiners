A toolbox for miRNA-disease association prediction. 

This toolbox contains 6 softwares:

1) MaxFlow (Combinatorial prioritization algorithm by imformatiion flow maximization)

2) Jiang’s method (Hypergeometric distribution based test)

3) RWRMDA ( Random Walk with Restart for MiRNA–Disease Association)

4) HDMP (Weighted K-nearest neighbors algorithm)

5) RLSMDA (Regularized Least Squares for MiRNA-Disease Association)

6) NCPMDA ( Network Consistency Projection for miRNA-Disease Associations)
