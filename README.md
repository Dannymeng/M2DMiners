A toolbox for miRNA-disease association prediction. 

This toolbox contains 5 softwares

1) Combinatorial prioritization algorithm by imformatiion flow maximization

2) Jiang’s method (hypergeometric distribution based test)

3) RWRMDA ( Random Walk with Restart for MiRNA–Disease Association)

4) MicroRNA-based similarity inference

5) K-nearest neighbors algorithm
